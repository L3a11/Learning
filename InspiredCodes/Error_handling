# In Python, errors can be handled using try-except blocks. This allows the script to try a block of code and catch any exceptions that may occur, providing helpful feedback to the user.

# Here is an example of error handling in Python:

    num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
    
    result = num1 / num2
    print("Result: ", result)
    
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
    
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

# In this example, the script attempts to perform division between two numbers inputted by the user. If a ValueError occurs (e.g., the input is not a number), a helpful error message is displayed. Similarly, if a ZeroDivisionError occurs, another specific error message is shown. Finally, a catch-all exception block is included to handle any other unexpected errors.

# By using try-except blocks in this way, Python scripts can provide helpful feedback to users when errors occur, improving the overall user experience.
