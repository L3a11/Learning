# Unit testing is a method of testing individual units or components of a software system in isolation to ensure each unit works correctly. It helps identify bugs early in the development process and provides assurance that each unit performs as expected. Integration testing, on the other hand, involves testing the interaction between different units or components to ensure that they work together as expected. It focuses on testing the integration points of the software system to verify that the different modules interact correctly. In web development, unit testing and integration testing are essential to ensure the reliability and functionality of the web application. There are several testing frameworks available in Python, such as unittest, pytest, and nose, that can be used for writing unit tests and integration tests. Here is a simple example of unit testing in Python using the unittest framework:

# test_calculator.py

import unittest
from calculator import add

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add(self):
        result = add(1, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

# In this example, we have a test case for the add function in a calculator module. The test_add method tests whether the add function correctly adds two numbers and returns the expected result.

# Integration testing in web development can involve testing the interactions between different components of a web application, such as the frontend and backend, database connections, API endpoints, etc. Here is an example of an integration test using the requests library in Python:

# test_api_integration.py

import requests
import unittest

class TestApiIntegration(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_api_endpoint(self):
        response = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json()['login'], 'octocat')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

        self.assertEqual(result, 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we have a test case for the `add` function in a `calculator` module. The `test_add` method tests whether the `add` function correctly adds two numbers and returns the expected result.

Integration testing in web development can involve testing the interactions between different components of a web application, such as the frontend and backend, database connections, API endpoints, etc. Here is an example of an integration test using the `requests` library in Python:

# test_api_integration.py

import requests
import unittest

class TestApiIntegration(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_api_endpoint(self):
        response = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json()['login'], 'octocat')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

# In this example, we are testing an API endpoint by making a request to the GitHub API and verifying the response status code and the expected data returned.
