# Beautiful Soup is a Python library that helps extract data from HTML and XML files. It makes web scraping easier by providing tools to navigate and search for tags, attributes, and text within HTML files.

# 1. Install Beautiful Soup using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

# 2. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
```

# 3. Retrieve the HTML content from a website:

```python
url = 'https://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.text
```

# 4. Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content:

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
```

# 5. Navigate through the HTML content to find the data you want:

```python
# Find all <a> tags with class 'title'
titles = soup.find_all('a', class_='title')

# Print the text content of each title
for title in titles:
    print(title.text)
```

# This is a basic example of how to use Beautiful Soup for web scraping. You can explore more functionalities of the library, such as navigating through the HTML structure, finding specific tags or attributes, and extracting data based on specific criteria.
