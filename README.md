# Learning
This repository serves as a collection of my own codes, codes that I've been inspired by or practiced, and my learning process and progress file.

In the **MyCodes** folder, you can find various code files that I have personally written. These codes showcase my ability and skills in programming.
The **InspiredCodes** folder contains codes that I have found inspiring or have used for practice. I have added comments to these codes to explain my thought process and understanding.
The **Learning Progress** file tracks my progress in learning programming and software development. I have added comments to document my learning journey and improvements.

Feel free to explore the repository and gain insights into my learning progress.
