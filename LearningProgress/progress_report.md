# Progress Report for First Year Developer Student

## Overview
Some of the applications I have worked to learn basic python include a rock, paper, and scissors game, a basic calculator, and a temperature converter.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
I successfully implemented a basic rock, paper, and scissors game using Python. The game allows the user to choose between rock, paper, and scissors and then randomly generates a choice for the computer.

## Basic Calculator
I have also developed a basic calculator application in Python. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## Temperature Converter
Another application I have worked on is a temperature converter. The converter allows the user to input a temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and converts it to the other unit. 

## Study Resources and References
Some of the resources I found helpful include:
- Online tutorials and courses on Python programming and inLearning
- Programming forums and communities for seeking help and advice
- Python documentation and guides for reference
- Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and problem-solving
